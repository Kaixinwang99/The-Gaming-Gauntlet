\doxysubsection*{Building Joy\+Controller}

Joy\+Controller is an executable that includes and implements the \mbox{\hyperlink{classJoyLib}{Joy\+Lib}} library. It is mainly to be used for tesing with HW

\doxysubsubsection*{Usage}

Make sure the current working directory is Joy\+Controller and run\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir build \&\& cd build }
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake ..}
\DoxyCodeLine{make }
\end{DoxyCode}


On successful build it will create an exxecutable named Joy\+Controller and you can run this\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./JoyController}
\end{DoxyCode}


For using the library with other modules, copy the \mbox{\hyperlink{classJoyLib}{Joy\+Lib}} folder to the required module/project folder and make sure the root C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt of that module adds the library by adding the following\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{add\_subdirectory(JoyLib)}
\DoxyCodeLine{target\_include\_directories(\$\{PROJECT\_NAME\} PUBLIC JoyLib)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{target\_link\_libraries(\$\{PROJECT\_NAME\} JoyLib)}
\end{DoxyCode}


\doxysubsection*{Testing}

Unit tests are written in the G\+Test framework. tests/\+Joy\+Test.\+cpp contains all the tests. The testing framework depends on Google\+Test, so to install and set up the gtest library, run the following commands\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt install libgtest-\/dev}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd /usr/src/gtest}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo cmake CMakeLists.txt}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo make}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo cp *.a /usr/lib}
\end{DoxyCode}


This will install and set up gtest to be used with cmake. Refer to the C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt in the tests folder to see implementation.

\doxysubsubsection*{Running tests}

To build and run tests, go to the root project folder which is Joy\+Controller. Build all the libraries and then run the test. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd buld          \#go to the build dir to keep the root dir clean }
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake ..         \#build all the objects}
\DoxyCodeLine{make             \#create executables}
\DoxyCodeLine{./tests/JoyTest  \#run the test}
\end{DoxyCode}
