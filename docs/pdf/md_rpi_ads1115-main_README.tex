The A\+D\+S1115 is a sigma delta converter which has a P\+GA and a programmable sampling rate from 8Hz..860Hz. It\textquotesingle{}s perfect for slowly changing inputs such as pressure, temperature, heart rate etc.

This repo offers the class {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classADS1115rpi}{A\+D\+S1115rpi}}} which manages the communication between the A\+D\+S1115 and the client who just needs to implement the callback {\ttfamily has\+Sample(float sample)} which is then called at the requested sampling rate.

The class uses the A\+L\+E\+R\+T/\+R\+DY pin of the A\+D\+S1115 connected to G\+P\+IO 17 to establish the sampling rate.

\doxysection*{Building\+:}

To build\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}cmake .

make
\end{DoxyVerb}


\doxysection*{Install}

\begin{DoxyVerb}sudo make install
\end{DoxyVerb}


\doxysection*{Usage example}

In the subdir {\ttfamily example} is a simple application which prints the A\+DC data to the screen or you can pipe it into a file. \begin{DoxyVerb}cd example
sudo ./ads1115_printer
\end{DoxyVerb}


\doxysection*{General usage}

The online doc is here\+: \href{https://berndporr.github.io/rpi_ads1115/}{\texttt{ https\+://berndporr.\+github.\+io/rpi\+\_\+ads1115/}}

You need to overload the abstract callback handler\+: {\ttfamily virtual void has\+Sample(float v) \{ \};} with the functionality you\textquotesingle{}d like it to do. You can switch the input channel within the callback handler to cycle through different inputs.

Start the data acquisition\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{myAD7705comm.start(settings)}
\end{DoxyCode}


Once {\ttfamily start} has been called {\ttfamily has\+Sample} will be called at the specified sampling rate.

Stop the data acquisition\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{myAD7705comm.stop();}
\end{DoxyCode}
